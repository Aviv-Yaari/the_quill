# The Quill
This is a simple blog posts app built with Next.js, TypeScript, and MongoDB. The app allows users to create posts, like posts, and add comments to posts.  
The motivation behind this project is my interest to learn how to use some cool Next.js features, such as server side rendering and static rendering, 
and to challenge myself by integrating with a MongoDB database without the help of Mongoose, and write complex native MongoDB queries, which is something I haven't had too much experience with.

## Features
### Create a Post
To create a post, click on the "Create Post" button in the navigation bar. You'll be taken to a form where you can enter the title and content of your post. Click the "Submit" button to create the post.

### Like a Post
To like a post, click on the heart icon next to the post. You can only like a post once.
